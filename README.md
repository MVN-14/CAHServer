##### THIS IS A BETA
This project was built as an exercise to learn the svelte framework.
The server is hosted on [Render](https://render.com/) for free so it spins 
down with inactivity. Upon first joining room it may take a minute for players
to connect. It has not been tested with multiple rooms and may slow down if it
scales, I don't anticipate this being used much so for now it should be fine.
